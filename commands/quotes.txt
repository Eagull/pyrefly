Advertising isn't a science. It's persuasion. And persuasion is an art.
An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.
The urbane activity which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
The great curse of our modern society is not so much the lack of money as the fact that the lack of money condemns a man to a squalid and incomplete existence.
So far as I can see, the atomic bomb has deadened the finest feeling that has sustained humankind for ages... The moral to be legitimately drawn from the supreme tragedy of the bomb is that it will not be destroyed by counter-bombs, even violence cannot be by counter-violence. Human kind has to get out of violence only through nonviolence. Hatred can be overcome only by love. Counter-hatred only increases the surface as well as the depth of hatred.

Politics is but a narrow field, and that still narrower highway yonder leads to it.  I some-times direct the traveler hither.  If you would go to the political world, follow the great road, -- follow that market-man, keep his dust in your eyes, and it will lead you straight to it; for it, too, has its place merely, and does not occupy all space.
